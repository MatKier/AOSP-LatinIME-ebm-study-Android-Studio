# Gradle build for AOSP-LatinIME-for-explicit-behavior-modification-study (Android Keyboard for Keystrokebiometrics study)
This Project is based on the LatinIME Android Keyboard (ttps://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/inputmethods/LatinIME) and Iwo BanaÅ›' (https://github.com/iwo/LatinIME-Android-Studio) Gradle build configuration.
The LatinIME was modified in two ways: 
1. It contains a logger class for logging all Keyevents (up&down including all interesting properties) to csv files 
2. It contains activities which are used for a behavior biometrics user study

The aim of this project and the corresponding user study is to check if (and how well) people can actively control their typing behavior regarding the following properties: key offset, hold time, flight time and touch area.
